# DIY Arduino Uno 

Micro controller boards are basically programmable state machines or a mini cpu 
which does not take sizable space and has RAM and Communication functionality 
built into it. In this project we will see how to make a breadboard version 
of the famous Arduino Uno board.

The following is a list of things you will require for building a breadboard version 

- AtMega328p U chip 
- 16 M Hz crystal oscillator 
- 22 pF Capacitors (2 pieces)
- 10k Ohms Resistor 
- push button 
- Jumper wires and Single strand wires for connection 
- 330 Ohm resistor 
- 1 LED (green or red both would work)
- USB to UART converter (for programming)
- Breadboard 
- wire cutter
